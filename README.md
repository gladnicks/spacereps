# SpaceReps
## About
This project is my personal attempt to replicate spaced repitition flashcard software such as SuperMemo or Anki, but in a very simple format for the
command line. SpaceReps does not provide any functionality that existing similar software does not; this is purely for the enjoyment I gain from
seeing how well I can remake something.

## Usage guide
After cloning, you can execute `python3 main.py` from the terminal to run the program. Currently, you are given the option to choose a deck to study
from. The program presents the cards to you repeatedly until you indicate that you remember them well enough.

## Upcoming features:
- Create, modify, and delete decks and the cards within them
- Implementation of SM-2 algorithm for spaced repetition
- Exception checking for user inputs
- More aesthetically appealing user interface
- Ability to quit the program at any time
