# SpaceReps
## About
This project is my personal attempt to replicate spaced repitition flashcard software such as SuperMemo or Anki, but in a very simple format for the command line. SpaceReps does not provide any functionality that existing similar software does not. I created this for two reasons:
1. I am quick with the command line and find this format more efficient for my study habits than using flashcard apps.
2. I really enjoy the challenge of seeing how well I can remake things.

## Usage guide
After cloning, you can execute `python3 main.py` from the terminal to run the program. Currently, you are given the options to add decks, add cards to decks, and study the decks.

## TODO / Upcoming features:
- Support the ability to delete and modify decks and the cards within them
- Exception handling
- More aesthetically appealing user interface
- Improved menu
- Cleaner and simpler code
