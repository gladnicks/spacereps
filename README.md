# SpaceReps
## About
SpaceReps is a web application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enables users to create and study decks of flashcards. SpaceReps utilizes an algorithm that uses data about your learning habits to calculate the optimal time to present cards for studying to maximize long-term memory retention. It is essentially a lite reimplementation of pre-existing spaced repetition flashcard software undertaken for the purpose of improving my web development skills.
