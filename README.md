# SpaceReps
## About
This project is my attempt at replicating existing spaced repitition flashcard software. Full functionality is currently supported for the command line with Python, but I am continuing to expand this project by making it into a web app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. SpaceReps does not provide any functionality that existing similar software does not. I created this for three reasons:
1. I find this format more efficient for my study habits than using flashcard apps.
2. I want to develop my JavaScript skills.
3. I really enjoy the challenge of seeing how well I can remake things.

## Usage guide
**Command Line**
After cloning, you can execute `python3 main.py` from the main `spacereps` project folder to run the program.
**Web App**
After cloning, execute `cd app`, then `python3 -m http.server`. Copy and paste the link from the output into a browser, e.g.
`http://localhost:8000`

## TODO / Upcoming features:
- Expansion of the web app
- Support the ability to delete and modify decks and the cards within them
- Comprehensive tests
