# SpaceReps
## About
This project is my attempt at replicating existing spaced repitition flashcard software.
Full functionality is currently supported for the command line with Python.
This project is currently being expanded into a web app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
SpaceReps does not provide any functionality that existing similar software does not.

## Usage guide
*Command Line*

After cloning, you can execute `python spacereps_command_line_program.py` from the main `spacereps` project folder to run the program.

*Web App*

After cloning, install `npm`, then run `npm install`. Once the dependencies have installed, run `npm start`, open a web browser, and navigate to `localhost:8080`.
If you make changes and don't see them reflected upon refreshing the browser, hit Ctrl + Shift + R or Command + Shift + R
