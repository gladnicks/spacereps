What we want:
spaced repetition flashcard app based on SM2 algorithm that works with the command line

- main python program that works similarly to whos that pokemon builder in class
options on startup:
- quiz me
	- program asks which deck you want to study, then quizzes you on each card if (current timestamp) > (I + last timestamp the card was studied), updating parameter metadata for each card studied. Cards you get wrong are NOT shown again until you've gone through the list once. Then, they are asked in order until you score them with 4 or more.
- decks folder wherein each deck is represented by a json file. each 'card' in the json file has two sections that represent front/back of the flashcard as well as lines at the bottom for metadata tracking parameters used by the SM2 algorithm.
- for now, I can create the cards and decks by hand. eventually, this functionality should be supported from the command line.



TODO:
- create some sort of schema for how the json files should be formatted for decks
